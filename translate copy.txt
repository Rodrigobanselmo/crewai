# Translation Instructions for SQL Query Generation

Purpose:
    - The translation should be in a format that the development team can understand to create an SQL query based on the user input.

General Rules:
    - Maintain the meaning and context of the original text.
    - Use clear and precise language suitable for SQL query formulation.

Specific Instructions:
    - Translate "atendimento" to "appointment" in every instance.
    - Translate "registro" to all of "medical record" in every instance.
    - Translate "gestor" to all of "manager" in every instance.
    - Translate "colaborador" to all of "colaborador" in every instance.
    - Translate "aluno" to all of "student" in every instance.
    - Ensure that the translated text clearly identifies the data points required for the SQL query.

Translation Format:
    - The translated text should be structured to facilitate the development of an SQL query.
    - Identify and clearly state the table names, columns, and any conditions or filters needed for the query.
